# Fix: "no main manifest attribute" Error

## The Problem

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file is missing the Main-Class manifest attribute, which means it's not a valid executable jar.

## ✅ Solution: Install Gradle and Generate Wrapper

The best solution is to install Gradle and let it generate a proper wrapper.

### Step 1: Download and Install Gradle

1. **Download Gradle 8.5:**
   - Go to: https://gradle.org/releases/
   - Click: **Gradle 8.5** → **Binary-only**
   - Download the ZIP file

2. **Extract Gradle:**
   - Extract to: `C:\gradle` (or any folder)
   - You should have: `C:\gradle\bin\gradle.bat`

3. **Add to PATH (Optional):**
   - Add `C:\gradle\bin` to your system PATH
   - Or just use the full path: `C:\gradle\bin\gradle.bat`

### Step 2: Generate Gradle Wrapper

Open Command Prompt and run:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\cryst\.vscode\Hack-the-Herd-F25-Wheely-Mammoth\demo
C:\gradle\bin\gradle.bat wrapper --gradle-version 8.5
```

This will create a proper `gradle-wrapper.jar` with the correct manifest.

### Step 3: Run Application

```cmd
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

## ✅ Alternative: Download Complete Wrapper from Spring Initializr

1. **Go to:** https://start.spring.io/

2. **Generate a new project:**
   - Project: **Gradle - Groovy**
   - Language: **Java**
   - Spring Boot: **3.5.7** (or latest)
   - Dependencies: **Spring Web**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Thymeleaf**
   - Click **Generate**

3. **Extract the ZIP file**

4. **Copy wrapper files to your project:**
   - Copy `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` from the generated project
   - Copy the entire `gradle/wrapper/` folder
   - Paste into your `demo` folder (overwrite existing)

5. **Run:**
   ```cmd
   gradlew.bat bootRun
   ```

## ✅ Quick Fix: Use Maven Instead (Temporary)

If Gradle continues to have issues, you could switch to Maven, but this requires changing `build.gradle` to `pom.xml`.

---

## Why This Happens

The jar file downloaded from GitHub raw might not have the proper manifest. The wrapper jar needs to be generated by Gradle itself or downloaded from an official repository with the correct structure.

**Recommended:** Install Gradle and run `gradle wrapper` - this guarantees a working wrapper!
